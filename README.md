# Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation

This project implements a deep learning approach to segment blood vessels from retina fundus images. It aims to support early detection of diseases like glaucoma by highlighting vascular structures in retinal scans.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a reliable and efficient segmentation model using U-Net architecture that can extract fine vessel structures from retinal images.

## 📌 Highlights

- Developed under the guidance of Dr. Jayaraj P. B. at NIT Calicut.
- Focused on medical image segmentation for glaucoma-related research.
- Dataset used from Kaggle (based on DRIVE dataset).
- Implemented in Python using PyTorch and OpenCV.
- Trained and evaluated on real-world retinal fundus images.
